# User Testing Script

Team-lol: Graciela Ortega, Erick Cabrera, Danny Martinez, John Balsamo

## Introduction

Welcome to the user testing stage of our website. We would like to thank you for accepting our invitation to be one of trial users and
ask that you please be as thorough as you can in your analysis throughout this session. The purpose of this website is to give students
who enroll in this course an organized place where they can view information on their class, such as homework, projects, or contact
information for the professor. Our goal is to make the website user-friendly and solve any issues you may encounter. The session
should take about 15 minutes.

As I said before, please be as thorough as you can in your analysis and know that there is no wrong answers here. You have the freedom to
speak your mind on whatever issue you encounter or whatever part of the website you liked. Any feedback, is good feedback.

With that being said, I will provide you with a pen and paper, or if you'd like you are welcome to use the notes program on the
computer/mobile device so that you could write down your feedback as we go.

*(Give pen and paper and/or help open Notes on computer/mobile device)

I will remain in the room ready to assist you if you need any help navigating the website, however, please hold any questions that you may
have until the end of the sessions.

Lastly, please know that any feedback you provide me today will be shared with the rest of the development team and will be used in our
class when presenting the final project. However, your personal information will not be shared. Now, if you could please take the time to
read and sign this form accepting your participation in the trial stage.

## Links

Thank you for playing along. Now, I have one more task for you. Take the next few minutes to click on every link that you see and verify
that they are working properly. If you encounter any link that does not work or is not sending you to the indicated place please make
sure to write it down in your feedback. Once you are finished, let me know. Again, I will be here if you need any assistance. Click away!

*(If 5 minutes pass and user is not finished, cut the activity short by saying the following sentence "For the sake of time, I ask that
you please stop your link clicking as we will be moving on.")

Thank you for checking our links.

## Grand Finale

Please take a few minutes to write down any additional feedback you may have of the website as a whole.
